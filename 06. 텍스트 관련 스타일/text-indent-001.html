    <p>Red wine is a type of wine made from dark-colored grape varieties. </p>
    <p class="indent1">The actual color of the wine can range from intense violet, typical of young wines, through to brick red for mature wines and brown for older red wines. [indent 15px] </p>
    <p>The juice from most purple grapes is greenish-white, the red color coming from anthocyan pigments (also called anthocyanins) present in the skin of the grape; exceptions are the relatively uncommon teinturier varieties, which produce a red-colored juice. </p>
    <p class="indent2">Much of the red-wine production process therefore involves extraction of color and flavor components from the grape skin. [indent 5%] </p>
    <p>Red wine is a delicacy around the world.</p>
