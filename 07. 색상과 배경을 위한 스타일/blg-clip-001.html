        <p><strong>Salmon</strong>is a popular food. 
            Classified as an oily fish, salmon is considered to be healthy 
            due to the fish's high protein, high omega-3 fatty acids, 
            and high vitamin D content. Salmon is also a source of cholesterol, 
            with a range of 23–214 mg/100 g depending on the species.
